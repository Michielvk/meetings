**Michiel**: Call to action to submit papers and share this workshop: https://bytecodealliance.org/wace2025

### Proposals and discussions

#### Present wasi-webgpu for proposed Phase 2 vote

**Mendy**: I'm working on wasi-gfx with Sean Isom. We're trying to move to Phase 2.

**Mendy**: We're renaming from wasi-webgpu to wasi-gfx, because we are going to encapsulate more things than just WebGPU. We are going tohave the following packages: Wasi-webgpu, an API generated from the WebGPU spec, with renames as appropriate but no semantic differences.

**Mendy**: Also have wasi-surface package, a surface/window that you can draw to and handle basic user input. On the web this would be implemented by canvas. A super basic window api.

**Mendy**: wasi-graphics-context, a point of connection between windowing system and graphics API. We'll talk in a minute about why there's an intermediate here rather than direct connection

**Mendy**: wasi-frame-buffer, an alternative to webgpu, for cpu based rendering

**Mendy**: The way things are connected: on the left, windowing systems. The wasi-surface is the only one now, but we anticipate there would be more added in the future here. In the middle is graphics-context. On the right there is wasi-webgpu and wasi-frame-buffer, and we anticipate there would be more of these added in the future. So, with both of these points of extensibility, we want one common context in the middle to connect them.

**Mendy**: During phase 1, we were expected to do these items per the wasi subgroup: add proposal listing, get a new repository, attempt to reach broad consensus, create an overview document, prototype implementations - in this we have a pretty substantial implementation, more than a prototype. 

**Mendy**: Phase 2 entry requirements: i'll show you our documentation in the proposal of portability criteria. Precise overview exists. Wit exists. All dependencies of the wit have reached phase 2.

**Mendy**: Here's our portability criteria right now: we will pursue linux, windows, macos, and android with wasmtime, and web with jco. There are implementations in progress for both wasmtime and jco.

**Bailey**: Any comments or questions before we vote? (none). Let's take a consensus poll about moving this to phase 2.

- SF: 14
- F: 8
- N: 0
- A: 0
- SA: 0

**Bailey**: wasi-gfx moves to phase 2. Congratulations Mendy and Sean.

#### Present wasi-messaging for proposed Phase 2 vote

**Dan**: Update on wasi-messaging. Wasi-messaging has been in phase 1 for 2 years now. Several rounds of review from stakeholders at wasmcloud, spin/fermyon, microsoft, fastly, and others. Also a review from Clemens Vasters, architect of Azure Event Hubs and etc. Taylor Thomas joined as a co-author.

**Dan**: Let's look at the interface itself. Two worlds: messaging core, and messaging request-reply. The second is a pattern that a lot of people use, so we want to meet the users where they're at. The producer implementation has a send function. We are trying to find something common for NATS, Kafka, Redis, and others. Incoming-handler the inspiration is from wasi-http, the difference is that there are no replies directly as the return value.

**Pat**: some questions around how the wit types work out, which Dan and Taylor answered.

**Luke**: The goal with wasi-http is the goal is to talk to any other http system, is the goal here to talk to any other wasi-messaging system or any other system connected to the messaging implementation?

**Dan**: The goal here is to just talk to a broker, so whatever else is connected to that broker is what you're messaging with.

**Luke**: So for example native implementations talking MQTT can send/receive these messages?

**Dan**: Yes

**Luke**: What about fields that exist for e.g. MQTT and don't exist in this standard?

**Dan**: Let the host handle possible problems.

**Luke**: I'm surprised if there aren't problems here since there are 2 or more distinct standards [ED: what were the standards here?] this is trying to bridge, whereas in HTTP we have one source of truth in the RFCs.

**Taylor**: We used to have way more stuff in this spec which introduced a lot of tension about how to get to many standards. We simplified this spec to be just what's in common. If someone is doing the work-stealing queue pattern they will probably implement that separately and deliver work items to the wasi-messaging handler interface. From what we can see from a big survey of messaging systems, we believe this set of attributes in the message is the common set.

**Luke**: So if there are things specific to an implementation e.g. “send this reliably” that would show up in the metadata fields? Or does that just not come up? Metadata seems like an escape hatch where all the broker-specific details go. In HTTP there were many headers that we had to standardize the specific meaning of a bunch of the headers because they directly affect the semantics of the program.

**Dan**: Yes, metadata is an escape hatch where anything a specific host needs, but I don't want that to hurt the portability of the interface.

**Luke**: If I run something successfully on one system with this interface, is it portable to another system with a different implementation?

**Taylor**: Metadata is like HTTP headers in that it might be semantic meaning or very specific to the system. The guarantee of this interface: I can receive a message that contains data, and maybe I can reply to that message. I can send a message however I like. Beyond that metadata is just specific to applications. This is meant to be simple because bigger patterns create a lot of assumptions.

**Kate**: Where is the client configured, such as quality of service, is that in metadata?

**Taylor**: similar pattern to wasi-keyvalue: tying it to some external configuration given by the host. Connect is just given a string name, it's not a URL with connect options, it's just a tag for all those details to be filled in by the host.

**Dan**: The other thing here is to get-topics from the host and subscribe to topics that way.

**Kate**: That makes sense, I don't know if people need to configure any of these things on a message-by-message basis

**Ralph**: When you lean into messaging, it's a lot like a specific flavor of SQL, you end up leaning into the specific flavor you're connecting to. You learn patterns / expertise for a given messaging system. A huge part of that is replicated here, there's tons of people say messaging is hard and that's how it needs to be. There's lots of things some systems provide and others don't, dead letters, poisoning detection, there's a very small subset of applications that actually want to use those. There is a top 3 or 4 things that almost every application wants to use. The effort here is to be on top of those really specific implementations. A whole bunch of people can use those implementations without worrying about the low level specifics by using those.

**Ralph**: What kinds of implementations have you gone through so far?

**Dan**: First iteration was Azure Service Bus, Event Hubs, NATS, Kafka.

**Taylor**: Those are the ones we did as well. In wasmcloud we are using NATS. Lot of ink spilled over this interface, we want people to implement it. Here's a 135 comment thread of discussion. We want to try it out - phase 2 isn't a commitment, it's that we are going to try implementing this and then collect feedback.

**Luke**: Is it a goal of the proposal that if you develop a system on one system like kafka, and then move it over to azure service bus and expect it to work. If there's semantic meaning put into this metadata, because kafka will interpet metadata one way and service bus won't. HTTP tries to have that property where it's not specific to the broker. So this is the question of scope: are we trying to be portable over all messaging systems, or just some?

**Dan**: Right now I believe that it's portable over all messaging systems. The metadata field could have expectations from a specialized host, we wouldn't target a custom host but off the shelf we wouldn't have expectations on the metadata they wouldn't be able to handle.

**Ralph**: I think we'll end up with implementation specific versions of functionality through the metadata field that most apps don't care about at all.

**Taylor**: Nobody should assume the metadata should mean anything to the host. It's not an escape hatch. If you're doing something really advanced you are going to move past wasi-messaging. The goal of this proposal is to cover a common 80%

**Luke**: So the docs should say that metadata is not supposed to be interpreted by the host? HTTP has a set of headers that are special and interpreted, but the rest are uninterpreted. If you specify it that all metadata is supposed to pass through uninterpreted, then that satisfies metadata not being an escape hatch

**Dan**: I believe that's the way our current implementations all work.

**Bailey**: We have had a lot of good discussion, we have seen that your current proposal seems to be ready. Can you add the results of today's discussion to your proposal and then vote on Nov 14, our next meeting?

**Taylor**: Nov 14 is during KubeCon when a lot of us will be out, but maybe we can duck into this meeting.

**Bailey**: Thanks for doing a good job keeping track of issues in the repo, let's capture these in there.


#### Markdown in proposal repos - does anyone use it? Pat Hickey


**Pat**: I find that the markdown in proposal repos isn't actually useful and it creates a lot of tedium in git. If you use it and find it useful, please let me know, otherwise I'll be moving to get rid of that.

**Bailey**: Please file an issue on WASI to discuss more there.
